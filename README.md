Part of this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

There are two main folders:

- frontend: ReactJS App
- backend: Node.js / Express API

## Running Locally

To run locally, cd (change directory) into each folder and run:

### `npm install`

and

### `npm start`

This will run both apps in the development mode.<br>

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the ReactJS app in the browser. The web app will reload if you make file edits.<br>

The Node.js / Express API will be running at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).

If something about this process or app doesn't work, or if you would like to provide feedback, please email lavinia.k@youtharabia.com - thanks.
